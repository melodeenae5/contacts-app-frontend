# Names 'n Stuff - client side

## Description

This is the client side of the contacts organizer web app I built called, "Names 'n Stuff". Users can create an account, login, and keep track of their contacts list through the app. If a user is not logged, in the app will redirect them to the login page. The idea for this app came from a friend. The main purpose is to organize contacts and track information you want to remember about people you may have just met, such as conversation topics.

Contact fields currently include the basics such as name, email, address, phone number, job title and company. In the interest of tracking things that allow you to truly get to know someone, contact fields also include things such as important dates, where we met, what we talked about, likes, dislikes, and passions. I would like to add a feature in the future to create color coded categories and categorize contacts into groups such as family, friends, coworkers, and colleagues. I would also like to add a search bar feature to search one's contact list by name.
